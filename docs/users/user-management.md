# User Management

Users are managed by the Support team at Carbon Re. To add or remove users, contact us at {{ support }} with your colleague's email address and name.

There is no limit to the number of authorised users who can be given access to the platform, and there is no hierarchy; all features (including data reports & recommendations) are accessible by every user registered in your organization.
