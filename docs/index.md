# Delta Zero User Guide

[Delta Zero](https://carbonre.com/deltazerocement) is a web-based platform that analyses inputs & outputs from cement plant production, and generates suggested changes to input parameters (such as kiln temperature, fuel type, O2 levels, etc) or ‘recommendations’ that are adapted to current conditions & priorities.

These recommendations empower cement manufacturers to make informed decisions to reduce their fuel costs & carbon emissions, while maintaining quality standards and adhering to the latest regulations. 

## Audience

This user guide is written primarily for cement plants with a single rotary kiln production line. Plants with multiple rotary kilns will have their own individual Machine Learning (ML) model, dataset, dashboard, and recommendations for each kiln line.

## Machine Learning

Recommendations are calculated by creating a “digital twin” of the cement plant, using data captured by remote sensors on site (namely in the pre-heater and kiln). Every 2 hours, thousands of simulations with different parameters are run against this Artificial Intelligence (AI) or ML model to find the optimal recommendation within a few seconds, which is then surfaced in Delta Zero.

## Sustainability

Our software uses technology and know-how that can only be found at leading technology companies and a few select universities around the world. We apply state-of-the-art artificial intelligence to solve complex industrial challenges in new, more effective, ways.
We have attracted experts from top global universities and technology companies to create Delta Zero: our shared belief is that we can have a fundamental impact on climate change by using this technology in cement production.
