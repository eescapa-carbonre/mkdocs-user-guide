# Data Access Requirements

Delta Zero requires a secure data pipeline connecting Carbon Re servers to your plant historian or database. This data must be available 24/7 for ingestion every 15 minutes.

The network infrastructure around the plant must be secured by a firewall. We can help you and provide guidance or consulting support if needed.
