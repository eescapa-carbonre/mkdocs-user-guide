## Data Policy

Your data is securely stored on Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers located in the United Kingdom (eu-west-2). It is used to display information in the Delta Zero dashboard & data reports, and to run the Machine Learning model (also hosted on AWS) to generate recommendations.

AWS is the most advanced cloud computing commercially available, with government-level security used by financial services providers and global banks. We will work with your IT team to create an encrypted secure tunnel of data to our servers on AWS.

Data storage is limited to 10 Terabytes (TB) per plant.
