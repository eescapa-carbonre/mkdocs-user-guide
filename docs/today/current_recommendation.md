A **recommendation** is a set of suggested changes to the recommendable metrics (plant parameters shown in <span style="color:#8aad66; font-weight:bold">light green</span>) that are forecasted to reduce carbon emissions & fuel costs.

A new recommendation is generated every 2 hours, alerting the user with a sound and notification banner that disappears after 30 minutes.

## Parameter States

The state of each recommendable metric is highlighted in the following colours:

- <span style="color:#8aad66; font-weight:bold">Green</span> (minor change): Recommended change is a minor adjustment compared to the current metric (shown in [Lab Data](lab_data.md) or [Sensor Data](sensor_data.md)).

- <span style="color:#F58302; font-weight:bold">Amber</span> (major change): Recommended change is a major adjustment compared to the current metric (shown in [Lab Data](lab_data.md) or [Sensor Data](sensor_data.md)).   

Each recommendation is subsequently recorded in [Historical Recommendations](historical_recommendations.md) (available to live plants only).
