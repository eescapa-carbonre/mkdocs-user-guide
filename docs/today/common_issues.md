To resolve, check the Warning message in the [Data Ingestion](data_ingestion.md) widget, and perform the action required for [Dashboard Live – Warning](data_ingestion.md#🟠-dashboard-live-–-warning) or [Dashboard not live!](data_ingestion.md#🔴-dashboard-not-live) accordingly.


### Sorry, recommended plant metrics are not currently available. <br />We are unable to validate plant data at this time.
