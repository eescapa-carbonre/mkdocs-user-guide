The **Average SHC** is calculated on a per-day (24-hour period based on your local timezone) or 7-day basis over the selected time period.

The white horizontal line indicates the **Baseline SHC** or average performance for the selected time period. 

If the <span style="color:#8aad66; font-weight:bold">Average SHC</span> (in green) is above the Baseline SHC (white), your emissions on that day were higher than the average observed in the selected time period.
