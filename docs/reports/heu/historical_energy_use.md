The **Historical Energy Use (HEU)** data report tracks the plant’s carbon emissions or specific heat consumption (SHC, in kcal/kg) over time.

This report can be customised to your specific needs, such as setting the daily average SHC to a weekly cadence, or displaying the data as bar graphs instead of line graphs.

To navigate this report, select the calendar icon in the **Start Date** and **End Date** to choose a custom time frame (both dates inclusive).

Alternatively, select the corresponding button to apply the desired time period of the data (inclusive of today):

- **1m** – Past 1 month (default)
- **3m** – Past 3 months
- **6m** – Past 6 months
- **1y** – Past 1 year
- **All** - All historical data from all time

    !!!warning 
        Charts may take additional time to load if filtered by **All**.
