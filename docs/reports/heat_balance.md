The **Heat Balance** data report is a visualisation of your plantâ€™s energy (fuel) input & output from the baseline period, excluding data from non-stable periods (such as plant startups and shutdowns).

![Heat Balance](../_assets/media/screenshots/reports/heat_balance.png)

All charts are measured in kcal/kg, displaying the following:

- **Average** of fuel input or output over the baseline period.
- **Best 10%** or average of the lowest 10% input/output over the baseline period.
- **Current** live plant data.

Charts in green are for energy input, yellow for calcination, and red for energy loss.

    These calculations are currently manually written into this report. Real-time dynamic values will be coming soon!

## Energy Flow

### Fuel Input

**Fuel input** or Specific Heat Consumption (SHC) of the fuel used to heat the kiln.

### Calcination Energy

**Calcination energy** (reaction enthalpy) used to heat the kiln. Historical data for Reaction Enthalpy is detailed at the bottom of the page.

### Cooler Loss

**Cooler loss** (excess cooler air loss) of energy in the form of excess hot (aspiration) air leaving the clinker cooler stack.

### Tower Loss

**Tower loss** (main stack loss) of energy in the form of hot air leaving the gas exit of the preheating tower.

### Evaporation Loss

**Evaporation loss** (moisure loss) in the feed, fuel, and combustion products.

### Shell Losses

**Shell losses** (cnvection &amp; radiation loss) of energy in the form of heat from convection and radiation in the kiln shell.

### Clinker Heat

**Clinker heat** loss of energy in the form of heat above the ambient temperature.

## Reaction Enthalpy

The **reaction enthalpy** data report shows all historical data points for [calcination energy](#calcination-energy).

The white horizontal line indicates the current calcination energy.
